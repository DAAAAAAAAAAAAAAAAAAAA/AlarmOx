# AlarmOx
FlummOx (Legacy - AlarmOx)
Custom Firmware for the Nintendo "Alarmo" making it be able to have custom themes and other stuff (ex games)
You will need prior Homebrew knowledge and have a USB port in your computer.
This is not "AlarmoHax", but a new project aiming to make the console have more stuff.
Please note that without soldering, you can only access partion one.
